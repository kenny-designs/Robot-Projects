/*
 *  bumper.cc
 * 
 *  Sample code for a robot that has two front bumpers and uses them to
 *  avoid obstacles. Suitable for use with the Roomba and Create. 
 * 
 *  Works IRL. Doesn't work so well in Stage, probably because of the
 *  crude modeling of the bumpers, and can get stuck in convex shapes
 *  when it backs into an object while trying to turn away from it.
 *
 *  Based on an example provided by Monica Anderson and Jeff Forbes,
 *  via Carlos Jaramillo, and changed to (hopefully) make it easier to
 *  understand.
 *
